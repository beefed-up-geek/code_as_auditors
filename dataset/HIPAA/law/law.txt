elements  and  requirements—(1)  Core  ele-
ments.  A  valid  authorization  under 
this  section  must  contain  at  least  the 
following elements:

to  be  used  or  disclosed  that  identifies 
the information in a specific and mean-
ingful fashion.

may  make  the  requested  use  or  disclo-
sure. 

(iv)  A  description  of  each  purpose  of 
the  requested  use  or  disclosure.  The 
statement  ‘‘at  the  request  of  the  indi-
vidual’’  is  a  sufficient  description  of 
the  purpose  when  an  individual  initi-
ates the authorization and does not, or 
elects  not  to,  provide  a  statement  of 
the purpose. 

(v)  An  expiration  date  or  an  expira-
tion  event  that  relates  to  the  indi-
vidual or the purpose of the use or dis-
closure.  The  statement  ‘‘end  of  the  re-
search  study,’’  ‘‘none,’’  or  similar  lan-
guage  is  sufficient  if  the  authorization 
is  for  a  use  or  disclosure  of  protected 
health  information  for  research,  in-
cluding  for  the  creation  and  mainte-
nance  of  a  research  database  or  re-
search repository. 

(vi)  Signature  of  the  individual  and 
date. If the authorization is signed by a 
personal  representative  of  the  indi-
vidual, a description of such represent-
ative’s  authority  to  act  for  the  indi-
vidual must also be provided. 

(2) Required statements. In addition to 
the  core  elements,  the  authorization 
must  contain  statements  adequate  to 
place  the  individual  on  notice  of  all  of 
the following:

the  authorization  in  writing,  and  ei-
ther:

tion  in  paragraph  (c)(2)(i)(A)  of  this 
section  is  included  in  the  notice  re-
quired  by  § 164.520,  a  reference  to  the

dition treatment, payment, enrollment 
or  eligibility  for  benefits  on  whether 
the  individual  signs  the  authorization 
when  the  prohibition  on  conditioning 
of authorizations in paragraph (b)(4) of 
this section applies; or 

(B)  The  consequences  to  the  indi-

§ 164.510 Uses  and  disclosures  requir-
ing  an  opportunity  for  the  indi-
vidual to agree or to object. 

A covered entity may use or disclose 
protected  health  information,  provided 
that  the  individual  is  informed  in  ad-
vance  of  the  use  or  disclosure  and  has 
the opportunity to agree to or prohibit 
or restrict the use or disclosure, in ac-
cordance  with  the  applicable  require-
ments of this section. The covered enti-
ty  may  orally  inform  the  individual  of 
and  obtain  the  individual’s  oral  agree-
ment or objection to a use or disclosure 
permitted by this section. 

(a) Standard: use and disclosure for fa-
cility  directories—(1)  Permitted  uses  and 
disclosure.  Except  when  an  objection  is 
expressed  in  accordance  with  para-
graphs  (a)(2)  or  (3)  of  this  section,  a 
covered health care provider may: 

(i) Use the following protected health 
information to maintain a directory of 
individuals in its facility: 

(A) The individual’s name; 
(B)  The  individual’s  location  in  the 
covered  health  care  provider’s  facility; 

(C)  The  individual’s  condition  de-
scribed  in  general  terms  that  does  not

tion about the individual; and 

(D)  The  individual’s  religious  affili-

ation; and 

(ii)  Disclose  for  directory  purposes 

such information: 

(A) To members of the clergy; or

other  persons  who  ask  for  the  indi-
vidual by name. 

(2)  Opportunity  to  object.  A  covered 
health  care  provider  must  inform  an 
individual  of  the  protected  health  in-
formation  that  it  may  include  in  a  di-
rectory  and  the  persons  to  whom  it 
may disclose such information (includ-
ing disclosures to clergy of information 
regarding religious affiliation) and pro-
vide  the  individual  with  the  oppor-
tunity  to  restrict  or  prohibit  some  or 
all of the uses or disclosures permitted 
by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 

(3)  Emergency  circumstances.  (i)  If  the 
opportunity to object to uses or disclo-
sures  required  by  paragraph  (a)(2)  of 
this section cannot practicably  be pro-
vided  because  of  the  individual’s  inca-
pacity  or  an  emergency  treatment  cir-
cumstance,  a  covered  health  care  pro-
vider may use or disclose some or all of 
the  protected  health  information  per-
mitted  by  paragraph  (a)(1)  of  this  sec-
tion for the facility’s directory, if such 
disclosure is: 

(A) Consistent with a prior expressed 
preference  of  the  individual,  if  any, 
that  is  known  to  the  covered  health 
care provider; and 

(B)  In  the  individual’s  best  interest 
as  determined  by  the  covered  health 
care provider, in the exercise of profes-
sional judgment. 

(ii)  The  covered  health  care  provider 
must inform the individual and provide 
an opportunity to object to uses or dis-
closures  for  directory  purposes  as  re-
quired  by  paragraph  (a)(2)  of  this  sec-
tion when it becomes practicable to do 
so. 

(b)  Standard:  uses  and  disclosures  for 
involvement  in  the  individual’s  care  and 
notification  purposes—(1)  Permitted  uses 
and  disclosures.  (i)  A  covered  entity

or  any  other  person  identified  by  the 
individual,  the  protected  health  infor-
mation  directly  relevant  to  such  per-
son’s involvement with the individual’s 
care or payment related to the individ-
ual’s health care. 

(ii)  A  covered  entity  may  use  or  dis-
close  protected  health  information  to 
notify,  or  assist  in  the  notification  of 
(including  identifying  or  locating),  a 
family  member,  a  personal  representa-
tive  of  the  individual,  or  another  per-
son responsible for the care of the indi-
vidual of the individual’s location, gen-
eral  condition,  or  death.  Any  such  use 
or disclosure of protected health infor-
mation  for  such  notification  purposes 
must be in accordance with paragraphs 
(b)(2),  (3),  or  (4)  of  this  section,  as  ap-
plicable. 

(2)  Uses  and  disclosures  with  the  indi-
vidual  present.  If  the  individual  is 
present  for,  or  otherwise  available 
prior  to,  a  use  or  disclosure  permitted 
by  paragraph  (b)(1)  of  this  section  and 
has  the  capacity  to  make  health  care 
decisions,  the  covered  entity  may  use 
or  disclose  the  protected  health  infor-
mation if it: 

(i)  Obtains  the  individual’s  agree-

ment; 

(ii)  Provides  the  individual  with  the 
opportunity to object to the disclosure, 
and  the  individual  does  not  express  an 
objection; or 

(iii)  Reasonably  infers  from  the  cir-
cumstances,  based  the  exercise  of  pro-
fessional judgment, that the individual 
does not object to the disclosure. 

(3)  Limited  uses  and  disclosures  when 
the individual is not present. If the indi-
vidual  is  not  present,  or  the  oppor-
tunity  to  agree  or  object  to  the  use  or 
disclosure  cannot  practicably  be  pro-
vided  because  of  the  individual’s  inca-
pacity  or  an  emergency  circumstance, 
the covered entity may, in the exercise 
of  professional  judgment,  determine 
whether the disclosure is in the best in-
terests of the individual and, if so, dis-
close  only  the  protected  health  infor-
mation that is directly relevant to the 
person’s  involvement  with  the  individ-
ual’s health care. A covered entity may 
use professional judgment and its expe-
rience  with  common  practice  to  make 
reasonable  inferences  of  the  individ-
ual’s best interest in allowing a person 
to  act  on  behalf  of  the  individual  to 

pick  up  filled  prescriptions,  medical 
supplies, X-rays, or other similar forms 
of protected health information. 

(4) Use and disclosures for disaster relief 
purposes.  A  covered  entity  may  use  or 
disclose  protected  health  information 
to a public or private entity authorized 
by law or by its charter to assist in dis-
aster  relief  efforts,  for  the  purpose  of 
coordinating  with  such  entities  the 
uses  or  disclosures  permitted  by  para-
graph  (b)(1)(ii)  of  this  section.  The  re-
quirements  in  paragraphs  (b)(2)  and  (3) 
of  this  section  apply  to  such  uses  and 
disclosure  to  the  extent  that  the  cov-
ered  entity,  in  the  exercise  of  profes-
sional  judgment,  determines  that  the 
requirements  do  not  interfere  with  the 
ability  to  respond  to  the  emergency 
circumstances.

for 
which  an  authorization  or  oppor-
tunity  to  agree  or  object  is  not  re-
quired.

protected  health  information  without 
the  written  authorization  of  the  indi-
vidual,  as  described  in  § 164.508,  or  the 
opportunity for the individual to agree 
or object as described in § 164.510, in the 
situations covered by this section, sub-
ject  to  the  applicable  requirements  of 
this  section.  When  the  covered  entity 
is  required  by  this  section  to  inform 
the  individual  of,  or  when  the  indi-
vidual may agree to, a use or disclosure 
permitted  by  this  section,  the  covered 
entity’s  information  and  the  individ-
ual’s agreement may be given orally.

quired by law. (1) A covered entity may

limited to the relevant requirements of 
such law. 

(2)  A  covered  entity  must  meet  the 
requirements  described  in  paragraph

authorized by law to receive reports of 
such  abuse,  neglect,  or  domestic  vio-
lence: 

ministrative,  or  criminal  proceedings 
or  actions;  or  other  activities  nec-
essary for appropriate oversight of: 

(i) To the extent the disclosure is re-
quired  by  law  and  the  disclosure  com-
plies  with  and  is  limited  to  the  rel-
evant requirements of such law; 

(ii) If the individual agrees to the dis-

closure; or 

(iii)  To  the  extent  the  disclosure  is 
expressly authorized by statute or reg-
ulation and: 

(A)  The  covered  entity,  in  the  exer-
cise  of  professional  judgment,  believes 
the  disclosure  is  necessary  to  prevent 
serious harm to the individual or other 
potential victims; or 

(B)  If  the  individual  is  unable  to 
agree  because  of  incapacity,  a  law  en-
forcement  or  other  public  official  au-
thorized  to  receive  the  report  rep-
resents that the protected health infor-
mation  for  which  disclosure  is  sought 
is  not  intended  to  be  used  against  the 
individual  and  that  an  immediate  en-
forcement  activity  that  depends  upon 
the disclosure would be materially and 
adversely affected by waiting until the 
individual  is  able  to  agree  to  the  dis-
closure. 

(2) Informing the individual. A covered 
entity  that  makes  a  disclosure  per-
mitted  by  paragraph  (c)(1)  of  this  sec-
tion  must  promptly  inform  the  indi-
vidual  that  such  a  report  has  been  or 
will be made, except if: 

(i) The covered entity, in the exercise 
of  professional  judgment,  believes  in-
forming the individual would place the 
individual at risk of serious harm; or 

(ii)  The  covered  entity  would  be  in-
forming  a  personal  representative,  and 
the  covered  entity  reasonably  believes 
the  personal  representative  is  respon-
sible for the abuse, neglect, or other in-
jury,  and  that  informing  such  person 
would  not  be  in  the  best  interests  of 
the  individual  as  determined  by  the 
covered  entity,  in  the  exercise  of  pro-
fessional judgment. 

(d)  Standard:  Uses  and  disclosures  for 
health  oversight  activities—(1)  Permitted 
disclosures.  A  covered  entity  may  dis-
close protected health information to a 
health  oversight  agency  for  oversight 
activities  authorized  by  law,  including 
audits;  civil,  administrative,  or  crimi-
nal  investigations;  inspections;  licen-
sure  or  disciplinary  actions;  civil,  ad-

(i) The health care system; 
(ii) Government benefit programs for 
which health information is relevant to 
beneficiary eligibility; 

(iii)  Entities  subject  to  government 
regulatory  programs  for  which  health 
information  is  necessary  for  deter-
mining 
compliance  with  program 
standards; or 

(iv)  Entities  subject  to  civil  rights 
laws  for  which  health  information  is 
necessary for determining compliance. 
(2) Exception to health oversight activi-
ties.  For  the  purpose  of  the  disclosures 
permitted  by  paragraph  (d)(1)  of  this 
section,  a  health  oversight  activity 
does  not  include  an  investigation  or 
other  activity  in  which  the  individual 
is  the  subject  of  the  investigation  or 
activity  and  such  investigation  or 
other activity does not arise out of and 
is not directly related to: 

(i) The receipt of health care; 
(ii)  A  claim  for  public  benefits  re-

lated to health; or 

(iii)  Qualification  for,  or  receipt  of, 
public  benefits  or  services  when  a  pa-
tient’s  health  is  integral  to  the  claim 
for public benefits or services. 

(3)  Joint  activities  or  investigations. 
Nothwithstanding  paragraph  (d)(2)  of 
this  section,  if  a  health  oversight  ac-
tivity  or  investigation  is  conducted  in 
conjunction  with  an  oversight  activity 
or investigation relating to a claim for 
public  benefits  not  related  to  health, 
the  joint  activity  or  investigation  is 
considered  a  health  oversight  activity 
for  purposes  of  paragraph  (d)  of  this 
section. 

(4)  Permitted  uses.  If  a  covered  entity 
also  is  a  health  oversight  agency,  the 
covered  entity  may  use  protected 
health information for health oversight 
activities  as  permitted  by  paragraph 
(d) of this section.

§ 164.524 Access  of  individuals  to  pro-

tected health information. 

(a) Standard: Access to protected health 
information—(1)  Right  of  access.  Except 
as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraph 
(a)(2)  or  (a)(3)  of  this  section,  an  indi-
vidual  has  a  right  of  access  to  inspect 
and  obtain  a  copy  of  protected  health 
information  about  the  individual  in  a 
designated record set, for as long as the 
protected  health  information  is  main-
tained in the designated record set, ex-
cept for: 

(i) Psychotherapy notes; 
(ii)  Information  compiled  in  reason-
able  anticipation  of,  or  for  use  in,  a 
civil,  criminal,  or  administrative  ac-
tion or proceeding; and 

(iii)  Protected  health  information 
maintained by a covered entity that is: 
(A)  Subject  to  the  Clinical  Labora-
tory  Improvements  Amendments  of 
1988,  42  U.S.C.  263a,  to  the  extent  the 
provision  of  access  to  the  individual 
would be prohibited by law; or 

(B) Exempt from the Clinical Labora-
tory  Improvements  Amendments  of 
1988, pursuant to 42 CFR 493.3(a)(2). 

(2)  Unreviewable  grounds  for  denial.  A 
covered  entity  may  deny  an  individual 

access without providing the individual 
an  opportunity  for  review,  in  the  fol-
lowing circumstances. 

(i)  The  protected  health  information 
is excepted from the right of access by 
paragraph (a)(1) of this section. 

(ii) A covered entity that is a correc-
tional  institution  or  a  covered  health 
care  provider  acting  under  the  direc-
tion  of  the  correctional  institution 
may  deny,  in  whole  or  in  part,  an  in-
mate’s request to obtain a copy of pro-
tected health information, if obtaining 
such copy would jeopardize the health, 
safety, security, custody, or rehabilita-
tion  of  the  individual  or  of  other  in-
mates, or the safety of any officer, em-
ployee,  or  other  person  at  the  correc-
tional institution or responsible for the 
transporting of the inmate. 

(iii)  An  individual’s  access  to  pro-
tected  health  information  created  or 
obtained  by  a  covered  health  care  pro-
vider in the course of research that in-
cludes  treatment  may  be  temporarily 
suspended for as long as the research is 
in  progress,  provided  that  the  indi-
vidual  has  agreed  to  the  denial  of  ac-
cess  when  consenting  to  participate  in 
the  research  that  includes  treatment, 
and  the  covered  health  care  provider 
has  informed  the  individual  that  the 
right  of  access  will  be  reinstated  upon 
completion of the research. 

(iv)  An  individual’s  access  to  pro-
tected  health  information  that  is  con-
tained  in  records  that  are  subject  to 
the  Privacy  Act,  5  U.S.C.  552a,  may  be 
denied, if the denial of access under the 
Privacy  Act  would  meet  the  require-
ments of that law. 

(v) An individual’s access may be de-
nied  if  the  protected  health  informa-
tion  was  obtained  from  someone  other 
than  a  health  care  provider  under  a 
promise  of  confidentiality  and  the  ac-
cess  requested  would  be  reasonably 
likely to reveal the source of the infor-
mation. 

(3)  Reviewable  grounds  for  denial.  A 
covered  entity  may  deny  an  individual 
access,  provided  that  the  individual  is 
given  a  right  to  have  such  denials  re-
viewed,  as  required  by  paragraph  (a)(4) 
of  this  section,  in  the  following  cir-
cumstances:

45 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–07 Edition) 

(i) A licensed health care professional 
has  determined,  in  the  exercise  of  pro-
fessional  judgment,  that  the  access  re-
quested  is  reasonably  likely  to  endan-
ger the life or physical safety of the in-
dividual or another person; 

(ii) The protected health information 
makes reference to another person (un-
less  such  other  person  is  a  health  care 
provider)  and  a  licensed  health  care 
professional has determined, in the ex-
ercise  of  professional  judgment,  that 
the access requested is reasonably like-
ly  to  cause  substantial  harm  to  such 
other person; or 

(iii) The request for access is made by 
the  individual’s  personal  representa-
tive  and  a  licensed  health  care  profes-
sional  has  determined,  in  the  exercise 
of professional judgment, that the pro-
vision  of  access  to  such  personal  rep-
resentative  is  reasonably  likely  to 
cause  substantial  harm  to  the  indi-
vidual or another person. 

(4)  Review  of  a  denial  of  access.  If  ac-
cess  is  denied  on  a  ground  permitted 
under  paragraph  (a)(3)  of  this  section, 
the individual has the right to have the 
denial  reviewed  by  a  licensed  health 
care  professional  who  is  designated  by 
the  covered  entity  to  act  as  a  review-
ing official and who did not participate 
in  the  original  decision  to  deny.  The 
covered  entity  must  provide  or  deny 
access  in  accordance  with  the  deter-
mination  of  the  reviewing  official 
under paragraph (d)(4) of this section.

tain  a  copy  of  the  protected  health  in-
formation  about  the  individual  that  is 
maintained  in  a  designated  record  set. 
The  covered  entity  may  require  indi-
viduals  to  make  requests  for  access  in 
writing,  provided  that  it  informs  indi-
viduals of such a requirement. 

(2)  Timely  action  by  the  covered  entity. 
(i)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraph 
(b)(2)(ii) of this section, the covered en-
tity must act on a request for access no 
later  than  30  days  after  receipt  of  the 
request as follows. 

(A)  If  the  covered  entity  grants  the 
request, in whole or in part, it must in-
form  the  individual  of  the  acceptance 
of  the  request  and  provide  the  access 

requested,  in  accordance  with  para-
graph (c) of this section. 

(B)  If  the  covered  entity  denies  the 
request,  in  whole  or  in  part,  it  must 
provide  the  individual  with  a  written 
denial,  in  accordance  with  paragraph 
(d) of this section. 

(ii)  If  the  request  for  access  is  for 
protected  health  information  that  is 
not  maintained  or  accessible  to  the 
covered  entity  on-site,  the  covered  en-
tity  must  take  an  action  required  by 
paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section by no 
later  than  60  days  from  the  receipt  of 
such a request. 

(iii) If the covered entity is unable to 
take  an  action  required  by  paragraph 
(b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section within 
the time required by paragraph (b)(2)(i) 
or (ii) of this section, as applicable, the 
covered entity may extend the time for 
such  actions  by  no  more  than  30  days, 
provided that: 

(A)  The  covered  entity,  within  the 
time  limit  set  by  paragraph  (b)(2)(i)  or 
(ii)  of  this  section,  as  applicable,  pro-
vides  the  individual  with  a  written 
statement  of  the  reasons  for  the  delay 
and the date by which the covered enti-
ty  will  complete  its  action  on  the  re-
quest; and 

(B) The covered entity may have only 
one  such  extension  of  time  for  action 
on a request for access. 

(c)  Implementation  specifications:  Pro-
vision  of  access.  If  the  covered  entity 
provides  an  individual  with  access,  in 
whole  or  in  part,  to  protected  health 
information,  the  covered  entity  must 
comply  with  the  following  require-
ments. 

(1)  Providing  the  access  requested.  The 
covered entity must provide the access 
requested  by  individuals,  including  in-
spection  or  obtaining  a  copy,  or  both, 
of  the  protected  health  information 
about  them  in  designated  record  sets. 
If  the  same  protected  health  informa-
tion that is the subject of a request for 
access  is  maintained  in  more  than  one 
designated  record  set  or  at  more  than 
one  location,  the  covered  entity  need

readily  producible  in  such  form  or  for-
mat; or, if not, in a readable hard copy 
form  or  such  other  form  or  format  as 
agreed to by the covered entity and the 
individual. 

(ii)  The  covered  entity  may  provide 
the  individual  with  a  summary  of  the 
protected  health

(A)  The  individual  agrees  in  advance 
to such a summary or explanation; and 
(B)  The  individual  agrees  in  advance 
to the fees imposed, if any, by the cov-
ered entity for such summary or expla-
nation. 

(3)  Time  and  manner  of  access.  The 
covered entity must provide the access 
as  requested  by  the  individual  in  a 
timely  manner  as  required  by  para-
graph  (b)(2)  of  this  section,  including 
arranging  with  the  individual  for  a 
convenient time and place to inspect or 
obtain  a  copy  of  the  protected  health 
information, or mailing the copy of the 
protected health information at the in-
dividual’s  request.  The  covered  entity 
may  discuss  the  scope,  format,  and 
other  aspects  of  the  request  for  access 
with  the  individual  as  necessary  to  fa-
cilitate  the  timely  provision  of  access. 
(4)  Fees.  If  the  individual  requests  a 
copy  of  the  protected  health  informa-
tion  or  agrees  to  a  summary  or  expla-
nation of such information, the covered 
entity  may  impose  a  reasonable,  cost- 
based  fee,  provided  that  the  fee  in-
cludes only the cost of: 

(i) Copying, including the cost of sup-
plies  for  and  labor  of  copying,  the  pro-
tected health information requested by 
the individual; 

(ii)  Postage,  when  the  individual  has 
requested the copy, or the summary or 
explanation, be mailed; and 

(iii)  Preparing  an  explanation  or 
summary of the protected health infor-
mation,  if  agreed  to  by  the  individual 
as  required  by  paragraph  (c)(2)(ii)  of 
this section. 

(d)  Implementation  specifications:  De-
nial  of  access.  If  the  covered  entity  de-
nies access, in whole or in part, to pro-
tected  health  information,  the  covered 

entity must comply with the following 
requirements. 

(1) Making other information accessible. 
The covered entity must, to the extent 
possible,  give  the  individual  access  to 
any other protected health information 
requested,  after  excluding  the  pro-
tected  health  information  as  to  which 
the  covered  entity  has  a  ground  to 
deny access. 

(2)  Denial.  The  covered  entity  must 
provide a timely, written denial to the 
individual,  in  accordance  with  para-
graph  (b)(2)  of  this  section.  The  denial 
must be in plain language and contain: 

(i) The basis for the denial; 
(ii)  If  applicable,  a  statement  of  the 
individual’s  review  rights  under  para-
graph (a)(4) of this section, including a 
description  of  how  the  individual  may 
exercise such review rights; and 

(iii)  A  description  of  how  the  indi-
vidual may complain to the covered en-
tity  pursuant  to  the  complaint  proce-
dures in § 164.530(d) or to the Secretary

name,  or  title,  and  telephone  number 
of  the  contact  person  or  office  des-
ignated in § 164.530(a)(1)(ii). 

(3)  Other  responsibility.  If  the  covered 
entity does not maintain the protected 
health  information  that  is  the  subject 
of  the  individual’s  request  for  access, 
and  the  covered  entity  knows  where 
the  requested  information  is  main-
tained, the covered entity must inform 
the  individual  where  to  direct  the  re-
quest for access. 

(4)  Review  of  denial  requested.  If  the 
individual  has  requested  a  review  of  a 
denial  under  paragraph  (a)(4)  of  this 
section,  the  covered  entity  must  des-
ignate  a  licensed  health  care  profes-
sional,  who  was  not  directly  involved 
in  the  denial  to  review  the  decision  to 
deny  access.  The  covered  entity  must 
promptly  refer  a  request  for  review  to 
such designated reviewing official. The 
designated  reviewing  official  must  de-
termine,  within  a  reasonable  period  of 
time, whether or not to deny the access 
requested  based  on  the  standards  in 
paragraph  (a)(3)  of  this  section.  The

revision,  if  the  covered  entity  has,  in 
accordance  with  § 164.520(b)(1)(v)(C),  in-
cluded  in  the  notice  a  statement  re-

serving its right to make such a change 
in its privacy practices; or

other  changes  to  policies  and  proce-
dures  at  any  time,  provided  that  the 
changes  are  documented  and  imple-

promptly document and implement the 
revised  policy  or  procedure.  If  the

promptly  make  the  appropriate  revi-
sions  to  the  notice  in  accordance  with
